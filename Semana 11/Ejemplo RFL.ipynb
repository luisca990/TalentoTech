La tarea principal del taxi es recoger a un pasajero en una ubicación y dejarlo en otra, garantizando que se cumplan los objetivos de llegar al destino correcto en el menor tiempo posible, respetando la seguridad del pasajero y las normas de tráfico.\n","\n","El problema se modela considerando aspectos clave como las recompensas, el espacio de estados y el espacio de acciones. Las recompensas guían al taxi, premiándolo por completar un viaje con éxito y penalizándolo por errores, como intentar dejar al pasajero en el lugar equivocado. El espacio de estados representa todas las situaciones posibles en las que el taxi puede encontrarse, mientras que el espacio de acciones define los movimientos y decisiones que el taxi puede tomar, como moverse en una dirección específica o recoger/dejar a un pasajero."],"metadata":{"id":"fJ5lC1slzqtZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Instalación de gym"],"metadata":{"id":"9oPKbbT3z6iL"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"zdNk3IYwy38K","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724672668393,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":13011,"user":{"displayName":"Luis Carlos Romero Cardenas","userId":"11570786301754282199"}},"outputId":"d6e99b20-fc5d-4623-e3f3-c7a231bda002"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: cmake in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (3.30.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (1.13.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: gym[atari] in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.25.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.18.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from gym[atari]) (1.26.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cloudpickle>=1.2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from gym[atari]) (2.2.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: gym-notices>=0.0.4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from gym[atari]) (0.0.8)\n","Collecting ale-py~=0.7.5 (from gym[atari])\n","  Downloading ale_py-0.7.5-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl.metadata (8.1 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: importlib-resources in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from ale-py~=0.7.5->gym[atari]) (6.4.3)\n","Downloading ale_py-0.7.5-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (1.6 MB)\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.6/1.6 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m9.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: ale-py\n","Successfully installed ale-py-0.7.5\n"]}],"source":["!pip install cmake 'gym[atari]' scipy"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Se carga el ambiente de juego y se muestra"],"metadata":{"id":"_ByrnGmb0R-M"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import gym\n","\n","env = gym.make(\"Taxi-v3\").env\n","env.reset()\n","env.render()"],"metadata":{"id":"Jg046YNI0AT9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724672671146,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2755,"user":{"displayName":"Luis Carlos Romero Cardenas","userId":"11570786301754282199"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"813c7a48-e641-4486-fb75-a6bb72611646"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/gym/core.py:317: DeprecationWarning: \u001b[33mWARN: Initializing wrapper in old step API which returns one bool instead of two.
